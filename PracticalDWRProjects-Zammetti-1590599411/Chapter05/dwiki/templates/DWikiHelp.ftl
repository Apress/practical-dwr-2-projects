<b>Using ~DWiki</b>

~To begin, only registered users may create, edit or comment on articles.
~Since security is provided by the container, an administrator will have to
create an account for you and assign you to the appropriate ~J2EE role.

~Once you have an account, click the ~Login link in the upper right-hand corner
to log in to ~DWiki, at which point you may create, edit or comment on articles.

~You can create an article at any time by editing an existing article and
entering any word beginning with a capital letters in it (with a minimum
word length of at least two characters).  ~Then, when you view the article,
simply click the new article link word and you'll be presented with the option
of creating the article.

~You can edit an existing article by clicking the ~Edit link in the top
navigation bar.  ~Make your changes and click the save button.

~When editing an article, you can enter ~HTML anywhere you please.  ~Note
however that articles are shown wrapped in &lt;pre&gt; tags.

~If you need to put a word in the article that ~DWiki would interpret as being
a link to an article, but you don't want it to be, preceed the word with a
tilde (~) character.  ~Note that you should save and check your article from
time to time to be sure something isn't being interpreted as an article link
that you didn't intend to be, and add a tilde as appropriate.

~You can comment on an article by clicking the ~Comment link in the top
navigation bar.  ~Enter your comment and click the save button.

~Every change to an article results in a history record being written, and you
can view the complete history of an article by clicking the ~History link in
the top navigation bar.  ~For each history record, you will be able to view the
state of the article before and after the change.

~You can search for an article by clicking the ~Search link on the left
navigation bar.  ~Once there, enter some text and select whether the search
should be against article titles, article text, or both.  ~Click the search
button, and your results will be displayed.  ~You can then click an article
title to view that article.

~You can see a list of all articles on the wiki by clicking the ~All ~Articles
~Index link on the left navigation bar.  ~You will be able to click any of the
article titles to view that article.

~You can return to the front page at any time by clicking the ~Front ~Page link
on the left navigation bar.

~Clicking the ~Help link on the left navigation bar brings you to this help
page.
