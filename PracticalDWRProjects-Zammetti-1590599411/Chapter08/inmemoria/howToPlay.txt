Welcome to InMemoria!

Playing the game is simple.  Begin by clicking the "Start A New Game" button.
Then, simply click two tiles on the Player playfield grid trying to find two
that match.  When you find them, they will explode and be cleared.  If the two
you chose are not a match, they will flip back over.  Play continues until
you clear all tiles.

Of course, it's not *quite* that simple!  The server will be playing against
you, and the thing is pretty good!  If it succeeds in clearing all its tiles
before you, then you lose.

So come on, beat that machine, the human race is counting on you!
