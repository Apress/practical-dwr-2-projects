    <h1>Using DWR File Manager</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    Using the DWR File Manager (Fileman) is very much like using the ubiquitous
    Windows Explorer. You can see a list of roots (or drives) available on the
    server's file system on the left. You can expand the branches of this
    directory tree, or click on a directory to view its contents.
    <br><br>
    On the right is the contents of the selected directory. You will see both
    files and directories here. For files, you will see its type, if Fileman
    recognized it, its size, and the date/time it was last modified. For
    directories, the size is always 0 and the type is always "Directory".
    <br><br>
    On the right you can select a single file or directory to operate on.
    When you do, the following toolbar icons are available:
    <br><br>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
      <tr><td width="50"><img src="img/icoEditFile.gif"></td><td>
        Edit the selected file.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="img/icoDelete.gif"></td><td>
        Delete the selected file or directory.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="img/icoCopy.gif"></td><td>
        Copy the selected file or directory to the clipboard for later pasting.
        The original file or directory will not be deleted when pasted.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="img/icoCut.gif"></td><td>
        Cut the selected file or directory to the clipboard for later pasting.
        The original file or directory WILL BE DELETED when pasted.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="img/icoPaste.gif"></td><td>
        Paste the file or directory currently on the clipboard, if any, to the
        currently selected directory.
      </td></tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    The following toolbar icons are available whether a file or directory is
    currently selected on the right or not:
    <br><br>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
      <tr><td><img src="img/icoUpOneLevel.gif"></td><td>
        Move up one level, i.e., the parent of the currently selected directory,
        if there is a parent.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td width="50"><img src="img/icoRefresh.gif"></td><td>
        Refresh the current directory. Note this does nothing if no file system
        root is yet selected.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="img/icoNewFile.gif"></td><td>
        Create a new file in the currently selected directory.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="img/icoNewDirectory.gif"></td><td>
        Create a new directory in the currently selected directory.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="img/icoUpload.gif"></td><td>
        Upload a file. File will be saved to the currently selected directory.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="img/icoDownload.gif"></td><td>
        Download the currently selected file.
      </td></tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    Note that all of these functions are also available from the menu bar.
    Speaking of the menu bar, the following addition functions are available
    there (these are not available on the toolbar):
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Tools... Print Directory Contents</b> - Provides a printable
        version of the file grid on the right.</li>
      <li><b>Help... Using Fileman</b> - Views this help file.</li>
      <li><b>Help... About</b> - Shows the About Fileman popup dialog.</li>
    </ul>
    To rename a file or directory, simply double-click the item to
    rename in the file grid, or click F2 while the row is selected, and you
    will be able to edit it in-place. The change occurs when you press Enter.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, the file grid can be sorted by clicking any of the column headers.
    <br><br>
    That's about it. Have a pleasent day!
